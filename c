INTRODUCTION
    The number of road accidents and the level of accident severity have been extensively applied as the indicators for measuring the efficiency of service provision in road 
network systems of each country.Road accidents are a major world economic and social problem as shown by the report of loss of lives and properties in many countries around the 
world. Reporting indicated the number of fatalities from road accidents per year of about 1.3 million and 50 million injuries were recorded [1] or an average of 3000 deaths/day 
and 30,000 injuries/day. Furthermore, its consequences have an impact on economic and social conditions in terms of health care costs of injuries and disabilities. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) [2] estimated the economic costs derived from road accidents reached 518 billion USD per year in high income countries and 65 billion USD per year in 
medium and low income countries.


PROBLEM
     The finding shows that affect the accident severity on expressways with the aim of providing benefits to the responsible authorities for issuing accident prevention policies 
or measures that are effective to alleviate or protect unexpected losses from accidents. The findings verified that speed on a road section is the only factor influencing the
severity of crashes on expressway with significance; hence speed limits on expressways should be mandated for drivers by carrying out rigorous inspections of expressway-speed 
under the regulations. As well, increasing awareness of accident severity caused by driving at excessive speeds should be promoted by authorities to potentially reduce the risks 
and levels of accident severity.
